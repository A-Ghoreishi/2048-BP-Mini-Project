# 2048-BP-Mini-Project
## Overview

2048 is a popular single-player puzzle game where the goal is to combine tiles with the same value to reach the 2048 tile. This project is a C++ implementation of the 2048 game. The game is played on a 4x4 grid where tiles are moved and combined based on user input. The game continues until no more moves are possible or the 2048 tile is reached.

## Features

- Playable game with a 4x4 grid.
- Supports user inputs for moving tiles in four directions (up, down, left, right).
- Tiles combine when they have the same value.
- Randomly generates new tiles after each move.
- Displays the current score and game over status.
- Selecting the color of the environment

## Prerequisites

- C++ compiler (e.g., g++, clang++)
- CMake (for building the project, optional but recommended)

## Installation
### Clone the Repository
First, clone the repository to your local machine:

bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/2048-cpp.git
cd 2048-cpp


## How to play
Use the keys (W for Up, S for Down,A for Left,D for Right) to move the tiles in the respective direction.
Tiles with the same value will merge into one tile with their combined value.
New tiles will appear in a random empty cell after each move.
The game ends when no more valid moves are possible or when the 2048 tile is reached.
